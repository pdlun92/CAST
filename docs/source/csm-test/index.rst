CSM TEST
========

The CAST repository contains a series of scripts, files, and tools that can be used to run a **Functional Verification Testing** **(FVT)** style regression test on any development work intended to for the CSM software packages.  Additionally, many of these tools have alternative utility uses as mechanisms for quick-install, uninstall, daemon status checking and similar tasks.  

All of the necessary files for CSM FVT can be found in the ``CAST/csmtest/`` directory
